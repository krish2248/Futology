## 🎯 Current Phase

**Phase 0** ✅ shell complete (Supabase + Husky/CI deferred until backend keys exist)
**Phase 1** ✅ in demo mode — login + onboarding + Cmd+K + middleware. Real Supabase swaps in when keys arrive.
**Phase 2** ✅ in demo mode — `/api/football/*` routes + TanStack Query + 30 s polling + StandingsTable + MatchDetailSheet (5 tabs) + per-league pages. Real RapidAPI wires in by replacing the demo branch in each route.
**Phase 4 (Match Predictor only)** ✅ in demo mode — `/api/ml/predict-match` returns deterministic seeded predictions; `/intelligence/match` is fully functional. The other 5 intelligence sub-pages remain placeholders.

Next session resumes: ask user for keys, then swap demo branches for real adapters one route at a time. Or keep building remaining intelligence sub-pages (Player Pulse, Sentiment, TacticBoard, Transfer Oracle, Fantasy IQ) which can be done in demo mode without external services.

## 📅 Session History

### Session 2 — 2026-05-01

**Goal:** Establish the data layer that Phase 2/3/4 will plug into. Build it on demo data first so `/scores`, `/leagues/[id]`, match details, and the Match Predictor all work end-to-end without external keys. When real keys land, only the inside of each `route.ts` changes.

**Built:**
- TanStack Query v5 + `Providers` wrapper in root layout (staleTime 30 s, gcTime 5 min, retry 1, no refocus refetch — per bible Phase 7)
- Demo API routes mirroring bible §10:
  - `GET /api/football/live-scores?status=&league=`
  - `GET /api/football/fixtures?status=&league=&team=`
  - `GET /api/football/match/[fixtureId]` — full detail (events, stats, lineups, H2H)
  - `GET /api/football/standings?league=` — rows + bands + league meta
  - `GET /api/football/search?q=&type=`
  - `POST /api/ml/predict-match` — body `{ home_id, away_id, competition_id }`
  - All set Cache-Control per bible (`no-store` for live, `s-maxage=300` for fixtures/standings, `s-maxage=3600` for finished/team/player/search). Returns `{ data, demo: true|false }`.
- `lib/api/config.ts` — central `isDemoMode`, cache-header table, `jsonResponse` helper
- `lib/api/client.ts` — typed `api.{liveScores,fixtures,match,standings,search}` consumed by hooks
- `hooks/useLiveScores.ts` — exports `useLiveScores` (30 s poll), `useFixtures`, `useMatchDetail`, `useStandings`
- `lib/data/demoMatchDetail.ts` — synthesizes events/stats/lineups (4-3-3 with normalised pitch coords)/H2H
- `lib/data/demoStandings.ts` — deterministic 16-team standings with bands per league
- `lib/ml/predictor.ts` — seeded match-prediction function (home advantage + tier bonus + 3 plain-English factors)
- `components/cards/StandingsTable.tsx` — sortable visually with European spots / relegation color bands, position arrows, form W/D/L pills, responsive hide-on-narrow columns, legend footer
- `components/cards/MatchDetailSheet.tsx` — slide-up on mobile, side-sheet on desktop. 5 tabs:
  - **Overview** — venue, referee, attendance, goalscorers
  - **Stats** — bidirectional bars (possession, shots, xG, corners, fouls, cards) with dominant-side highlight
  - **Lineups** — accurate-proportion pitch SVG with 22 player dots in 4-3-3 + lineup lists
  - **Events** — chronological timeline with home/left, away/right alignment
  - **H2H** — last 5 meetings + win-tally pills
- `components/intelligence/TeamPicker.tsx` — searchable team selector with click-outside + ESC
- `app/intelligence/match/page.tsx` + `MatchPredictorView.tsx` — full Match Predictor: two team pickers, animated probability bar, predicted score, confidence pill, key factors. Specific route takes precedence over the dynamic `[slug]` placeholder.
- `app/leagues/[leagueId]/page.tsx` — SSG'd for all 20 league IDs, hosts the StandingsTable. `/leagues` index page now lists every league as a clickable card.
- `app/HomeLive.tsx` — pulled the home page's live-strip into a client component fed by TanStack Query so it auto-refreshes without making the whole page client.
- `components/shared/ApiError.tsx` — designed error state with retry CTA used by all data-driven views.
- `components/providers/Providers.tsx` — QueryClientProvider with the Phase 7 defaults.
- Refactored `ScoresView`, `HomePage`, `LeagueDetailView` to fetch via the API + TanStack Query; click any MatchCard or LiveStrip card → opens `MatchDetailSheet`.

**Verified working:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean
- `npx next build` → 24 routes (6 dynamic API routes, 20 SSG league pages, intel/match static, all others static), middleware 25.6 KB
- Smoke test on dev server (port 3002):
  - `GET /api/football/live-scores?status=live` → 200, returns 3 live demo matches
  - `GET /api/football/standings?league=39` → 200, full Premier League table with bands
  - `GET /api/football/search?q=barcelona` → 200, returns the club + 3 Barcelona players
  - `GET /api/football/match/1` → 200, full detail with events/stats/lineups/H2H
  - `POST /api/ml/predict-match {home_id:541, away_id:529}` → 200, "predictedScore":"3-2", confidence 46%
  - `GET /leagues/39` → 200/19 KB (StandingsTable rendered)
  - `GET /intelligence/match` → 200/21 KB (Match Predictor rendered)

**Architectural choice — intentional swap point:**

Each `route.ts` has a single `if (isDemoMode)` branch returning seeded data. Phase 2 cutover will replace just the body of that branch with a `fetch` to RapidAPI / Supabase / the FastAPI ML service — the route signature, response envelope (`{ data, demo }`) and Cache-Control header all stay the same. The hooks (`useLiveScores`, `useStandings`, `useMatchDetail`) and components don't change.

Same for `/api/ml/predict-match` — the body branch swaps to a `fetch` to the FastAPI ML service authenticated by `ML_SERVICE_TOKEN`. Until then, `lib/ml/predictor.ts` simulates the same return shape as the bible §9.1 spec (home/draw/away probs, predicted score, confidence, key factors).

**Next session starts here:**
1. Read `SESSION.md`. Confirm Phase 2 demo data layer is in place.
2. Decide: keep building intelligence pages (no keys needed) OR provision keys and start cutover.
3. **If continuing in demo mode:** build the next intelligence pages —
   - `/intelligence/players` — Player Pulse cluster scatter (custom SVG, 6 named clusters per bible §9.2)
   - `/intelligence/sentiment` — Sentiment Storm timeline (Recharts AreaChart) + gauges + excitement meter
   - `/intelligence/tactics` — TacticBoard xG shot map on pitch SVG
   - `/intelligence/transfer` — Transfer Oracle (predicted value + SHAP-style factor list + comparable players)
   - `/intelligence/fantasy` — Fantasy IQ optimizer (greedy demo solver, formation pitch view)
4. **If cutting over:** add `lib/supabase/{client,server,middleware}.ts`, replace the demo branches one route at a time. Apply the schema from bible §6 to Supabase.

### Session 1 — 2026-04-30

**Goal:** Read the project bible. Scaffold the Next.js project. Configure dark-only design system. Build a navigable shell so the next session can start filling in real features.

**Decisions made:**
- Project lives at `C:\Users\sonik\Desktop\Sick-Boy\futology` (sub-folder, keeps the bible at the root).
- `npm` instead of `pnpm` (npm 11 already installed; avoids extra install step). Can switch later.
- Skipping `npx create-next-app` — scaffolding manually for predictable, non-interactive setup on Windows.
- Building Phase 0 + the layout shell from Phase 1 in one go so the user has a clickable, navigable UI by end of session.
- Skipping Husky/lint-staged/CI for session 1 — not in a git repo yet, and nothing to gate. Will revisit when remote is set up.

**Built this session (33 files):**

*Project scaffolding (`futology/`)*
- `package.json` — Next 14.2.18 + React 18 + Tailwind 3.4 + TS 5.6 + lucide-react + clsx/tailwind-merge
- `tsconfig.json` — strict, `@/*` path alias
- `next.config.js` — image remote hosts for API-Football, football-data, Transfermarkt
- `postcss.config.js`, `tailwind.config.ts` — full dark-only color tokens (bg, accent, premium, live, text), keyframes (live-pulse, fade-in, shimmer)
- `.gitignore`, `.eslintrc.json`, `.env.example` (every key from bible §7), `next-env.d.ts`

*Design system & layout*
- `app/globals.css` — base resets, dark scrollbar, focus rings, `.surface` / `.live-dot` / `.skeleton` / `.tabular` / `.container-page` / `.safe-bottom` utilities, `prefers-reduced-motion` honored
- `app/layout.tsx` — Inter via `next/font/google`, `<html className="dark">`, skip-to-content link, sticky Navbar, fixed MobileNav
- `lib/utils/cn.ts` — clsx + tailwind-merge
- `lib/constants/navigation.ts` — single source of truth for primary 5-tab nav + secondary nav
- `lib/constants/intelligence.ts` — 6 intel features (slug, title, tagline, description, icon)
- `components/layout/Navbar.tsx` — desktop top nav with primary + secondary links, search/bell stubs
- `components/layout/MobileNav.tsx` — bottom 5-tab nav with safe-area insets, 44px tap targets, scale-95 active feedback
- `components/shared/PageHeader.tsx` — title + description + optional action
- `components/shared/Card.tsx` — surface vs. surface-elevated, optional hover glow
- `components/shared/EmptyState.tsx` — icon + title + description + optional action (centered)
- `components/shared/LiveBadge.tsx` — full vs. dot variant, both pulse
- `components/shared/StatTile.tsx` — label / value / hint, tabular numerals

*Pages (12 total, all prerendered static)*
- `app/page.tsx` — hero + Live-Now placeholder + 3 quick-link cards + 4-stat snapshot + News placeholder
- `app/scores/page.tsx` — All/Live/Finished/Scheduled filter tabs + empty state
- `app/predictions/page.tsx` — 4 tabs (AI/Mine/Leagues/Community) + 4-stat row + ML preview card
- `app/intelligence/page.tsx` — 6-card hub + 4-stat model performance row
- `app/intelligence/[slug]/page.tsx` — single dynamic placeholder for all 6 intel sub-pages (statically generated for match/players/sentiment/tactics/transfer/fantasy)
- `app/profile/page.tsx` — guest header + sign-in CTA + 4-stat row + settings card
- `app/clubs/page.tsx`, `app/leagues/page.tsx`, `app/tournaments/page.tsx` — header + empty state
- `app/not-found.tsx` — 404 with home CTA
- `app/loading.tsx` — global skeleton (header + 4 tiles + main panel)

*Repo metadata*
- `SESSION.md` — this file (project root, alongside the bible)
- Memory files saved at `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`: user profile, project, session workflow, UI direction

**Verified working:**
- `npm install` → 391 packages, no errors.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean (no output = no errors).
- `npx next build` → ✓ compiled, all 17 routes prerendered static, first-load JS 87–94 KB.
- `npx next dev` smoke test (curl):
  - `GET /` → 200 (41 KB)
  - `GET /intelligence` → 200 (43 KB)
  - `GET /intelligence/match` → 200 (21 KB)
  - `GET /this-does-not-exist` → 404 (correctly returns the not-found page)
- Dev server cleanly stopped (PID 28184 killed).

**Blocked / deferred:**
- **Supabase project + schema (bible §6):** can't apply schema until the user creates a Supabase project. Listed in External Accounts table. Phase 1 auth flow is blocked on this.
- **Husky / lint-staged / Conventional Commits / GitHub Actions CI:** deferred — the repo isn't on GitHub yet. Will set up after the per-file commits push lands.
- **Real shadcn/ui components:** the bible names shadcn primitives (Button, Sheet, Tabs, Dialog, etc.). I've built the equivalents inline as plain Tailwind components for now (Card, EmptyState, StatTile). When we hit Phase 1 auth UI, we'll either install shadcn or keep going with our own — decide then.
- **Framer Motion / TanStack Query / Zustand / Recharts / Plotly:** not installed yet. Will install per phase as features land (auth doesn't need any of them; live scores will need TanStack Query).

**Session 1 part 2 additions (continued working):**

*Auth, onboarding, route protection*
- `lib/store/session.ts` — Zustand store with localStorage persist; sets `futology_session` cookie on sign in; `signIn`, `signOut`, `completeOnboarding`, `toggleLeague/Club/Player/Tournament`, `reset`. Designed so swapping in Supabase changes only the persistence layer.
- `hooks/useHydratedSession.ts` — `useIsClient()` to avoid SSR hydration mismatch on persisted state.
- `middleware.ts` — gate every dashboard route on `futology_session` cookie; allowlist `/login` and `/onboarding`; preserve a `?next=` redirect target.
- `app/login/page.tsx` — Framer-animated three-state flow (form → sent → ready) with email validation. Sets the demo session.
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx` — three-step wizard: leagues (20) → clubs (40+, debounced search) → players (24) + tournaments (10). Progress bar springs, step transitions slide, confetti fires on completion.

*Seed data (`lib/data/`)*
- `leagues.ts` — 20 leagues with API-Football IDs (matches bible §11 Phase 1)
- `clubs.ts` — 40+ clubs across the top 6 leagues, with `clubsByLeague`, `findClub`, and `CLUB_QUICK_PICKS`
- `players.ts` — 24 star players with positions and nationalities
- `tournaments.ts` — 10 majors (World Cup, Euros, Copa, AFCON, Asian Cup, CWC, plus domestic cups)
- `demoMatches.ts` — relative-time-based matches: 3 live, 4 finished, 11 scheduled across 6 leagues; helpers for filter & league grouping
- `demoPredictions.ts` — deterministic ML-style predictions (home/draw/away probabilities, predicted score, confidence, key factors)

*Components*
- `components/cards/MatchCard.tsx` — three implicit variants via match status; LiveStrip wrapper for horizontal scroll on Home
- `components/predictions/WinProbabilityBar.tsx` — segmented bar with dominant-side accent
- `components/predictions/PredictionCard.tsx` — ML badge, prob bar, predicted-score trio, expandable key factors, "Use this prediction" + "Save"
- `components/shared/SearchModal.tsx` — Cmd+K / `/` shortcut, debounced 300 ms, keyboard nav, 4 tabs (All/Teams/Players/Leagues), recent in localStorage
- `components/layout/NotificationBell.tsx` — popover with unread count, mark-all-read, click-outside + Esc to close
- `lib/utils/format.ts` — `formatKickoff`, `formatScore`, `formatRelativeMinute`

*Wired pages*
- `/` — hero + live strip pulling 3 live demo matches
- `/scores` — filter tabs (All/Live/Finished/Scheduled with counts), grouped by league, MatchCard everywhere
- `/predictions` — AI tab now shows 8 PredictionCards with deterministic seeded data; other tabs are designed empty states pointing at later phases
- `/profile` — real user from Zustand, sign-out wired, follow counts and previews from store

*PWA*
- `public/manifest.json`, `public/icon.svg`, `app/icon.svg` for the App Router favicon convention, `public/robots.txt`
- `metadata.manifest = "/manifest.json"` in `app/layout.tsx`

**Verified working (final smoke test):**
- `npx next build` → 20 static routes, middleware 25.6 KB. Login 4.45 KB / 143 KB FLJS, onboarding 10.3 KB / 150 KB.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` → clean.
- Dev server smoke test:
  - `GET /` (no cookie) → **307** redirect to `/login` ✓
  - `GET /login` → 200 ✓
  - `GET /onboarding` → 200 ✓
  - `GET /scores` (with `futology_session` cookie) → 200 (39 KB) ✓
  - `GET /predictions` (with cookie) → 200 (52 KB) ✓

**Next session starts here:**

1. Read `SESSION.md`. Confirm Phase 1 demo-mode is in place.
2. Ask the user for: Supabase project URL + anon key + service role, API-Football RapidAPI key, NewsAPI key, Reddit credentials.
3. **Cut over from demo to real:**
   - Install `@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`, `@tanstack/react-query`.
   - Add `lib/supabase/{client,server,middleware}.ts`.
   - Apply the schema from bible §6 in the Supabase SQL editor; generate `types/database.ts` via `supabase gen types`.
   - Replace `signIn` in `lib/store/session.ts` with a call to `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp`.
   - Replace `middleware.ts` cookie check with `supabase.auth.getUser()` from `@supabase/ssr`.
   - Persist follows to `user_followed_*` tables instead of localStorage.
4. **Phase 2 — live data:**
   - `app/api/football/{live-scores,fixtures,standings,team/[teamId],match/[fixtureId],search}/route.ts` — proxy API-Football, never expose key. Cache-Control per route per bible §10.
   - `lib/api/football.ts` helpers: `getCurrentSeason`, `formatFixture`, `formatStandings`, `formatPlayer`.
   - `hooks/useLiveScores.ts` with TanStack Query and 30 s polling.
   - Swap `getDemoMatches()` calls for live data hooks.
   - Build the MatchDetailSheet (5 tabs) per bible §2.1.
   - Build StandingsTable for `/leagues/[leagueId]`.
5. Run lint + typecheck + build before declaring Phase 2 done.

## 📐 Design Principles (locked in)

1. **Dark mode only.** No theme toggle. `#0A0A0A` background, `#00D563` accent, `#FFD700` premium, `#FF3B3B` live.
2. **Mobile-first.** Test at 375px before considering anything done.
3. **Minimal & navigable.** Per user direction in session 1: keep UI simple and easy to navigate. No clutter; clear hierarchy; bottom-tab nav on mobile, top nav on desktop.
4. **Functional over fancy.** Skeleton loaders, empty states, error states are required, not optional.
5. **TypeScript strict.** No `any`, no `@ts-ignore`.

## 🐛 Known Issues / Tech Debt

- **Demo Supabase shim.** The login flow currently sets a `futology_session` cookie and stores user state in localStorage via Zustand. When the user provides Supabase keys, swap `lib/store/session.ts#signIn` to call `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp` and replace the cookie with the Supabase SSR session cookie. The middleware.ts contract (cookie present = authenticated) is intentionally swap-compatible.
- **Demo data branches in API routes.** Each handler in `app/api/**` has a single `if (isDemoMode)` branch returning seeded data. Replacing the body of that branch with a `fetch` to RapidAPI / FastAPI is the entire Phase-2/3 cutover for that route. The route signature, response envelope (`{ data, demo }`) and Cache-Control header all stay the same.
- **PredictionCard demo path on `/predictions`.** Still imports from `lib/data/demoPredictions` directly. Should be migrated to `/api/ml/predict-batch` (POST `[fixture_ids]`) once that endpoint exists.
- **NotificationBell uses 3 hard-coded notifications.** Replace with a Supabase Realtime subscription on `notifications` table in Phase 5.
- **`SearchModal` reads `lib/data/*` directly.** Could be migrated to `/api/football/search` for consistency, but the current local search is already debounced and fast — defer until there's a reason.
- **Inline Tailwind components stand in for shadcn/ui primitives.** Working fine; decision deferred — install shadcn for the Sheet/Tabs/Dialog primitives in Phase 2 if a feature needs them, otherwise stay custom.
